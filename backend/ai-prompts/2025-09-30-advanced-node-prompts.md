# 2025-09-30 - Advanced Node.js Features Prompt / AI Response Snapshot

## Prompt
"Add placeholders/examples for advanced Node.js features:
- clustering (multi-core API scaling),
- worker_threads (analytics aggregation),
- Node streams (bulk import/export of products)."

## AI Response (abridged)
- Suggested using cluster in index.js to fork per CPU core.
- Suggested worker_threads for analytics aggregator script.
- Suggested stream.pipeline() for import/export endpoints.

## Human in the loop
- Did not fully implement (timebox constraint).
- Added TODO comments and minimal scaffolding so these can be demoed verbally if needed.

## Notes
- commit: "Add advanced Node.js feature scaffolding (cluster, worker threads, streams)."
